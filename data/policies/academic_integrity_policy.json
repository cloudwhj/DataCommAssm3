Academic misconductConduct by a student that is intended, or likely to have the eﬀect of obtaining, for that student or any other person, an advantage in the performance of assessment by unauthorised, dishonest, unethical or unfair means whether or not the advantage was obtained. See also the Student Conduct Policy . Academic Registrar's GroupStudent Conduct unit within the Integrity. Assessment taskmeans any examination, essay, assignment, practical or vocational placement or other work, in whole or in part, which forms part of a student's academic assessment. College Quality Enhancement Team (or Equivalent)teams led by the Senior Manager Quality Enhancement within the colleges. Collusionis unauthorised collaboration. Occurs where more than one student contributes to an assessment task that is submitted as the work of an individual student where the collaboration is not permitted for the assessment task. Collusion may also occur in group work where unauthorised collaboration occurs between groups. Contract cheating is the use of outsourced material for the purpose of submission by a student for assessment. The person submitting the work is being dishonest by representing it as their own. This diﬀers from traditional forms of plagiarism, which more commonly involves copying of existing submitted or published work. Contract cheating can take on many forms and is not limited to the purchasing of assessment material from online sources. Students may obtain assessments from peers or ‘tutors’ and the arrangement may not involve a ﬁnancial exchange. Signiﬁcantly, the submitted work is usually original in nature making it diﬃcult to detect using text matching plagiarism software. Copyingoccurs when paragraphs, sentences, a single sentence or signiﬁcant parts of a sentence, or the key points or structure of another person’s work have been used in an assessment without acknowledging the source. Course materialsmeans materials produced by staﬀ to support or facilitate teaching, learning, development and assessment such as: lecture or tutorial notes, presentations, recordings, assessment tasks and documentation (essay, assignment, test or exam questions, grading rubrics or assessment criteria), study guides and resources. Fabricationoccurs when a student claims to have carried out tests, experiments, research or observations that have not taken place. Falsiﬁcationinvolves the misrepresentation of research data, source material or results, or the presentation of results that are not supported by the evidence. Impersonationinvolves the completion and submission of an assessment task by another person that dishonestly misrepresents themselves as the person to whom the assessment task was assigned. Impersonation can also take place in the context of invigilated assessment wherein a person completes the assessment on behalf of another whilst dishonestly misrepresenting their identity. Plagiarismthe presentation of the work, idea or creation of another person as though it is one’s own. Plagiarism is a form of cheating and is a serious academic oﬀence that may lead to expulsion from the University. Plagiarised material can be drawn from, and presented in, written, graphic or visual form, including electronic data, and oral presentations. Plagiarism occurs when the origin of the material used is not appropriately cited. This document may be varied, withdrawn or replaced at any time.

Occurs where more than one student contributes to an assessment task that is submitted as the work of an individual student where the collaboration is not permitted for the assessment task. Collusion may also occur in group work where unauthorised collaboration occurs between groups. Contract cheating is the use of outsourced material for the purpose of submission by a student for assessment. The person submitting the work is being dishonest by representing it as their own. This diﬀers from traditional forms of plagiarism, which more commonly involves copying of existing submitted or published work. Contract cheating can take on many forms and is not limited to the purchasing of assessment material from online sources. Students may obtain assessments from peers or ‘tutors’ and the arrangement may not involve a ﬁnancial exchange. Signiﬁcantly, the submitted work is usually original in nature making it diﬃcult to detect using text matching plagiarism software.
