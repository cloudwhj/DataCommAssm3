For higher education programs, please see the Higher Education new program and program amendmentsi. schedule on the Program and Course forms webpage for program and course amendment dates. Section A: Program Guides (9) The program guide sets out the program requirements a student must fulfil to be eligible for the award. (10) A separate program guide is created for each partner and/or campus offering. Exceptions may apply to administrative programs, exchange programs, non-award programs, programsa. delivered by third-parties, or in consultation with Academic Governance. (11) Once a program guide in ‘submitted’ or ‘endorsed’ status has been approved, it is published as soon as practicable upon confirmation of approval. To comply with records management of program approvals, the approved program guide is published beforea. any further changes can be made. The publication timeline of an approved program guide may take into account professional accreditation and/orb. offshore regulatory requirements. (12) A program guide is created for each intermediate award, even where these are only available as exit awards. (13) A program guide is written in second person, for example: using language such as ‘you will’. (14) Where the program offering is registered for delivery to students studying on a student visa in Australia, the program guide complies with the National Code of Practice for Providers of Education and Training to Overseas Students 2018 (National Code 2018), including: the provision of accurate and accessible information to assist students in making informed decisions about thea. program the provision of RMIT’s CRICOS registered name and registered number b. the provision of information about any non-tuition fees anticipated for students to complete the program c. ensuring overseas students have sufficient English language proficiency, educational qualifications and/or workd. experience to enrol in the program. (15) For a program to be described as professionally accredited in the program guide, it must hold an active professional accreditation status by the relevant body. A program may be described as having conditional and/or provisional accreditation status in the program guidea. where these classifications are appropriate to the relevant body. Where a professionally accredited program is offered at a new campus or partner location, the owning college isb. responsible for confirming the accreditation status of the new offering and amending the program guide information accordingly.

(19) Where professional accreditation status is described as conditional, students should be clearly informed prior to their program enrolment if there is a risk that the program might not obtain full accreditation and the impact to their qualification if professional accreditation is not successfully obtained. (20) If the status of professional accreditation changes, the college must fully inform affected students of the potential impact on their studies and future employment outcomes. (21) Where core courses differ between locations and all program offerings lead to professional accreditation, the program guide External Accreditation and Industry Links section identifies which course titles and codes are required for professional accreditation for each additional plan offering. For example, if a partner institution outside Australia requires a specific course to meet accreditationa. requirements for that location, the program guide accreditation statement for that location plan advises students of courses required to fulfil accreditation requirements."

The Course Guide Part A is published as public facing information and provides a course synopsis with keya. attributes such as credit points and course learning outcomes that are applicable to all offerings and student cohorts. The Course Guide Part B contains more detailed internally facing information, such as the teacher/s, campus orb. modality, instruction mode/s, teaching schedule, assessment tasks and resources. This information may be provided to members of the public, such as industry partners, upon request. i. A separate Course Guide Part B is provided for each delivery of a course specific to a location or modalityii. and teaching period, or class, in the case of flexible terms. Student delivery and/or curriculum and assessment information that is not provided in the Course Guideiii. Part B must be accessible in the learning management system.

Common terminology for WIL placement activities includes practical placement, practicum, cooperative education, clinical placements, ﬁeldwork, and internship. Projects WIL projects are co-designed with industry and/or community partners. Industry engaged projects commonly require teams or individual students to undertake a real project that is based on real problems or addresses the needs of the industry or community. It may include capstone projects, collaborative research projects, multi-disciplinary projects or work-based projects. Industry partners are engaged in the project and provide feedback to students. Industry engaged WIL projects may be paid or unpaid. They may take place on campus, oﬀ campus, oﬀshore or online. Simulated workplace environmentsWIL activities in simulated workplace environments may be necessary for ethical, safety or professional reasons or when other forms of industry engaged WIL are unavailable. These environments are designed to simulate real workplaces in their function, equipment and mode of operation so that students can experience a variety of scenarios and inter-related activities similar to real work experience in the industry or profession to which the program leads. This type of WIL can occur face-to-face or online, on campus or oﬀ campus, and is usually unpaid. This document may be varied, withdrawn or replaced at any time.

Nominal Program Duration and Volume of Learning (39) The nominal program duration stated in a program guide should be the AQF volume of learning appropriate to the AQF qualification type, expressed in terms of a full-time enrolment in the two Melbourne standard semesters per year. That is, one AQF year equals two Melbourne standard higher education semesters with a full-time enrolment of 48 credit points per semester, or two Melbourne vocational education semesters with a full-time enrolment of 720 scheduled contact hours in total for both semesters. Refer to the Enrolment Procedure for further information. The full load in Vocational Education will be dependent on the nominal hours for the program or skillset. a. (40) If a program can be offered both on full-time and part-time basis, the full-time basis is quoted first in the program guide, and then the part-time basis afterwards in this exact format: (for example, ‘three years full-time, six years part- time’ or ‘six months full-time, 12 months part-time’). (41) Programs with CRICOS registration state the program duration separately for domestic and students studying on visas. For example, ‘Domestic students three years full-time, six years part-time; International students three years full-time’. (42) The defined program credit points for higher education or nominal hours for vocational education needed to complete a program comply with the AQF volume of learning appropriate to the AQF qualification type.

Section B: Course Guides (45) The Course Guide is the approved statement of the course requirements, attributes, learning outcomes and assessment. As such, it forms part of the enrolment agreement with the student. (46) The Course Guide is comprised of a Course Guide Part A and a Course Guide Part B. The Course Guide Part A is published as public facing information and provides a course synopsis with keya. attributes such as credit points and course learning outcomes that are applicable to all offerings and student cohorts. The Course Guide Part B contains more detailed internally facing information, such as the teacher/s, campus orb. modality, instruction mode/s, teaching schedule, assessment tasks and resources. This information may be provided to members of the public, such as industry partners, upon request. i. A separate Course Guide Part B is provided for each delivery of a course specific to a location or modalityii. and teaching period, or class, in the case of flexible terms. Student delivery and/or curriculum and assessment information that is not provided in the Course Guideiii. Part B must be accessible in the learning management system. (47) Accurate and current information in each field of the Course Guide Part A must be completed for endorsement and publication before the Course Guide/s Part B can be published. (48) The information provided in the Course Guide Part B matches the information in the Course Guide Part A and the learning management system shell. Any change to content that affects the accuracy of information in both Parts A and B must be made first in Parta. A and approved by the College Associate Deputy Vice-Chancellor Learning and Teaching (or equivalent). (49) A Course Guide is written in the second person, for example, ‘you will’. Changes to Course Guides (50) Any changes made to course learning outcomes, assessment and/or curriculum in Course Guides needs to be evaluated to determine whether the changes require the creation of a new course. This decision must be made according to the following principles: students who have successfully passed the course must not be made to repeat the superseded course within 10a. years as part of their transition or completion requirements. Refer to the Currency of Learning Guideline for further information whether the superseded course needs to continue being delivered as part of a teach-out arrangement b. whether the existing course is included in credit mapping as part of an articulation agreement c. whether the creation of a new course may reduce any adverse impacts on the student experience d.

(51) Changes to the Course Guide Part A should be made at least two weeks prior to the commencement of the teaching period the changes are intended to start in, and in or after the final week of semester where the course is delivered over consecutive semesters. For example, changes to take effect for semester 2, 2023 should be made during the final week of semester 1, 2023. All changes to Course Guide Part As are approved by the College Associate Deputy Vice-Chancellor Learninga. and Teaching (or equivalent or delegate). Any changes to a Course Guide Part A made during a teaching period also affects the Course Guide Part B forb. every subsequent teaching period. Where the course is offered in multiple locations with overlapping teaching periods, changes to Course Guidec. Part As should be made in consultation with the Academic Governance team, who can advise date windows to update Course Guide Part As concurrently for all locations. (52) Changes to Course Guide Part Bs are approved by the Program Manager (or equivalent or delegate) and can be made up until the first day of classes for each relevant teaching period that is covered by the guide. Colleges may institute their own approval level higher than the Program Manager. (53) For changes to assessment in course guides, please refer to the relevant section of the Assessment and Assessment Flexibility Policy ."

Common terminology for WIL placement activities includes practical placement, practicum, cooperative education, clinical placements, ﬁeldwork, and internship. Projects WIL projects are co-designed with industry and/or community partners. Industry engaged projects commonly require teams or individual students to undertake a real project that is based on real problems or addresses the needs of the industry or community. It may include capstone projects, collaborative research projects, multi-disciplinary projects or work-based projects. Industry partners are engaged in the project and provide feedback to students. Industry engaged WIL projects may be paid or unpaid. They may take place on campus, oﬀ campus, oﬀshore or online. Simulated workplace environmentsWIL activities in simulated workplace environments may be necessary for ethical, safety or professional reasons or when other forms of industry engaged WIL are unavailable. These environments are designed to simulate real workplaces in their function, equipment and mode of operation so that students can experience a variety of scenarios and inter-related activities similar to real work experience in the industry or profession to which the program leads.

Term Deﬁnition PlacementsThese activities are generally on-site placements in a workplace or community setting, can be onshore, oﬀshore or online, and may be paid or unpaid. Common terminology for WIL placement activities includes practical placement, practicum, cooperative education, clinical placements, ﬁeldwork, and internship. Projects WIL projects are co-designed with industry and/or community partners. Industry engaged projects commonly require teams or individual students to undertake a real project that is based on real problems or addresses the needs of the industry or community. It may include capstone projects, collaborative research projects, multi-disciplinary projects or work-based projects. Industry partners are engaged in the project and provide feedback to students. Industry engaged WIL projects may be paid or unpaid. They may take place on campus, oﬀ campus, oﬀshore or online. Simulated workplace environmentsWIL activities in simulated workplace environments may be necessary for ethical, safety or professional reasons or when other forms of industry engaged WIL are unavailable. These environments are designed to simulate real workplaces in their function, equipment and mode of operation so that students can experience a variety of scenarios and inter-related activities similar to real work experience in the industry or profession to which the program leads. This type of WIL can occur face-to-face or online, on campus or oﬀ campus, and is usually unpaid. This document may be varied, withdrawn or replaced at any time.
